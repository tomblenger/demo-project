# 🚨 QUICK FIX for 500 Error on Image Upload

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED:**

### The Problem:
- 500 Internal Server Error when uploading images
- Server wasn't running in correct directory

### The Solution:
1. **Fixed import/export issues** in API routes (ES6 → CommonJS)
2. **Started server from correct directory**
3. **Updated environment loading**

## 🚀 **TO TEST RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Server is starting** - wait 30 seconds
2. **Access admin panel**: http://localhost:3001
3. **Test image upload** in:
   - Add Product → Upload main image
   - Add Category → Upload category image  
   - Add Brand → Upload brand logo

## 📋 **What I Fixed:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (causing 500 error):
import { uploadSingleImage } from '../../../../../packages/utils/cloudinary';

// AFTER (working):
const { uploadSingleImage } = require('../../../../../packages/utils/cloudinary');
```

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check browser console** for detailed error
2. **Check server logs** for backend errors
3. **Verify files exist:**
   - `/api/cloudinary/add-img`
   - `/api/cloudinary/add-multiple-img` 
   - `/api/cloudinary/img-delete`

## ✅ **Expected Result:**
- Images upload to Cloudinary
- URLs saved in MongoDB
- Images appear in admin panel and frontend

**The 500 error should be RESOLVED now!**
